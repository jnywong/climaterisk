## Module Objectives

### Overall Objective: 


Explore and access NASA's open products and data , in particular Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWx) to visualise the extent of monsoon flooding in a specific area of interest (AOI) over a specific time period. Our case study will be the floods in Pakistan during September 2022.


### Specific Objectives:

1. Access the Jupyter Hub environment provided by 2i2c.
1. Discovering and access to NASA’s collection of Earth science data using the  site EarthData  as entry point.

1. Query and retrieve data from the DSWx-HLS data collection for a specific region of interest and time period.

1. Generate a map showing the area of interest and the intersecting tiles.

1. Create a table with the search results.

1. Visualize a flood map highlighting in the area of interest(AOI) flooded areas e, indicating the extent of flooding.
