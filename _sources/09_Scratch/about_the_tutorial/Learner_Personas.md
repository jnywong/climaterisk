## Learner personas:

 ### 1. Martín

Martin is a 35-year-old geographer, father of twins and living in Puerto Rico, who works in public management and needs to learn techniques that allow him to enrich their action proposals, such as how to take advantage of open databases with remote sensing data. He will not perform the analyses himself, but he wants to know what can be done with these open data.

#### Objectives

- Become familiar with NASA’s remote sensing data and understand the types of data they provide and the potential products that can be generated.

- Identify and understand practical applications of remote sensing data in the context of public management.

- Learn what online platforms and tools are available to access and analyze remote sensing data.

#### Challenges

2. Limited budget

3. Lack of trained human resources

4. Limited time to learn the necessary concepts.


### 2. Marcia

Marcia is a 30-year-old woman who lives in the basement of her parent’s house in the suburbs while she finishes her MBA in Public Affairs. She leads a small team of 5 people working in a local government office. She oversees a project to improve water distribution in a rural region. She needs to learn how to analyze remote sensing data to identify areas with water shortages. As her resources are limited, she wants to take advantage of open databases storing satellite images and data. She will perform the analyses directly together with her team and will advise her supervisor in deciding which strategies to follow.

#### Objectives

- Learn how to access and process NASA’s remote-sensing data

- Inspect libraries and tools to process the different types of data provided by satellites

- Identify and understand practical applications of remote sensing data in the context of public management.

- Generate insights that can be used to drive decision-making.

#### Challenges

- Competency in Python programming but lacking specific technical knowledge about remote sensing data

- Limited paid time to learn the necessary concepts

- Needs approval to implement solutions


### 3. Ana

Ana is an agronomist who has recently completed her Master's in Hydrology, during which she focused on studying the seasonal variability of water resources in the inter-Andean valleys region in Bolivia. Additionally, she is a member of a community of practice dedicated to analysing and making geospatial data available that promotes open science. She is interested in designing a water resources management course with open data, specifically targeting individuals familiar with geospatial data but in need of learning how to analyze satellite images for flood zone detection.

#### Objectives:

- Acquire effective teaching practices for delivering a course on satellite data analysis.

- Learn about available online platforms and tools for accessing and analyzing remote sensing data.

- Develop skills to integrate case studies into the context of water resources management, providing practical applications of satellite image analysis.

#### Challenges:

- Teach data analysis in an easy and user-friendly manner to individuals without programming knowledge.

- Work with data, materials, and workflows that adhere to the principles of open science.
