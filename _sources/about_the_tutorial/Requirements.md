## Participant requirements

The following are the requirements needed for the course:


### Required:

- **A free NASA EarthData user account.**

  - To access the data used in this course, you will need a free NASA EarthData user account. You can create an account on the NASA EarthData website ([https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/ ](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/)).

* **A free user account on GitHub.**

     - To download the course source code, you will need a free user account on GitHub. You can create an account on the GitHub website (<https://github.com/>).

- **A 2i2c hub user account.**

  - To run the course notebooks, you will need a free 2i2c hub account. You can create an account on the 2i2c website (Link).

* **Fundamentals of Spatial Data.** 
This course assumes a basic understanding of how geographic information is represented digitally. This includes concepts like points, lines, and areas used to represent locations on Earth.  You also should have knowledge about geospatial concepts such as coordinate systems and geographic data formats.

* **Basic Python programming knowledge with focus in data analysis.**
Since the course involves data manipulation and the use of code for spatial analysis, some experience with Python programming is required, particularly for data analysis. The course utilizes specialized Python libraries for working with spatial data. While not mandatory, familiarity with libraries like pandas (data analysis), geopandas (geographic data), or rasterio (reading/writing raster data) can be helpful.


### Desirable:

- Taking the NASA Open Science 101 course.

### Additional Considerations for the Course.

While not required, completing NASA Open Science 101 can give you a strong foundation in open science principles and practices that will help you in this course.
